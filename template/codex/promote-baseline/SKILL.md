# Promote Baseline Skill

## Goal
Safely “publish” completed work into baseline.

## Preconditions
- Cycle state is DONE (or VERIFYING completed)
- No unresolved GAPs (or explicitly justified)
- REQs have traceability or justification

## Steps

1) Ask for target cycle id/path (or infer from snapshot).
2) Validate:
- status.md state
- gap-report.md open items
- traceability completeness (or notes)
3) If validation fails:
- produce a checklist of what’s missing
- stop (do not promote)

4) If validation passes:
- Update docs/audit/baseline/current.md:
  - bump version (user chooses v0.2, v0.3…)
  - summary
  - included cycles
- Append to docs/audit/baseline/history.md
- Update docs/audit/index.md if needed
- Update snapshot:
  - remove cycle from active
  - set next entry point

Output:
- Promotion summary
- New baseline version
- Next entry point
